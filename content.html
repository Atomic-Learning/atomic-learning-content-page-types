<h2>Content Page Types</h2>

<p>There are several different types of content page that can be created in the Atomic Learning platform. This page describes some of the common ones.</p>

<h3>Didactic</h3>

<p>Didactic content pages are designed to teach specific new concepts and skills.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Pages containing examples will often take what has been taught in didactic pages and provide practical discipline-specific applications or scenarios to reinforce learning.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<p>Exercises are designed to provide learners with opportunities to practice and apply what they have learned in didactic and example pages. Activities may be integrated into the Atomic Learning Platform, direct students to perform activities on the own (e.g. on paper, or on their own computer), or be reflective.</p>

<h3>Sample Solutions</h3>

<p>Most exercises will have one or more sample solutions, which should each be on their own page of content. Exercises with more than one sample solution may address different approaches to a task or reflect the approach which may be taken by learners with different levels of experience. Each sample solution for an exercise may have different prerequisites to support the approaches used in that specific sample solution.</p>

<h2>Unsupported Page Types</h2>

<p>Some types of content are not supported in the Atomic Learning Platform. If you wish to include any of these activities in a series of activities for students, it is advised that you provide these types of content in other ways, and provide links to Learning Paths within the Atomic Learning platform alongside these other resources.</p>

<h3>Assessments</h3>

<p>Assessments are not supported in the Atomic Learning Platform. It is not possible to create pages that require the completion of a specific assessment or evaluation to mark as complete.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Learners are not able to interact with each other or with authors or teachers directly through the Atomic Learning Platform.</p>
